## About
Cosmic sources, including the Sun, intermittently emit X-ray bursts with varying amplitude and duration. These bursts typically show a fast rise and slow decay, with variable timings.

Automating the identification of such bursts will streamline analysis and enhance scientific investigation.

This is a fullstack website for the purpose but lacks a ML model, which will be adding soon.
